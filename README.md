(2) Tools

**Python:** for data transformation and visualization (interactive & static).

Python was used to generate trend line visualizations across different demographics.
The data was transformed into a long format, integrating Race, Gender, and Education to facilitate deeper analysis and more insightful visualizations.

**SQL:** to explore and extract key findings.

SQL was employed to extract key findings related to: (1) Wage percentage changes over time; (2) Wage gaps between demographics; (3) Lowest and highest wages among different demographic groups.


(3) Finding Summary

This project reveals that, despite gradual improvements, women consistently earn less than men, and significant racial disparities persist. White men continue to generate the highest incomes compared to women and other racial groups, such as Black and Hispanic communities. These disparities are further exacerbated at the intersection of race and gender, with Black and Hispanic women earning the least. While some progress has been made in narrowing the gaps during specific periods, the wage gap remains a deeply entrenched issue, highlighting the ongoing need for policies and interventions to achieve income equity across all demographics.
